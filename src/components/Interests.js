      <p>
        I always loved sports and music. As a boy, I played basketball in a team and I played the drums in a band. I always studied music and I did many concerts in professional environments. 
        I still love sports and I go to the gym every week. I also like to take care of my nutrition by cooking some healthy meals when Iâ€™m at home.
